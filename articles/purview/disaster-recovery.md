# Disaster recovery for Microsoft Purview

This article explains how to configure a disaster recovery environment for Microsoft Purview. Azure data center outages are rare, but can last anywhere from a few minutes to hours. Data Center outages can cause disruption to environments that are being relied on for data governance. By following the steps detailed in this article, you can continue to govern your data in the event of a data center outage for the primary region of your Microsoft Purview account.

## Achieve business continuity for Microsoft Purview

Business continuity and disaster recoveryâ€¯(BCDR) in a Microsoft Purview instance refers to the mechanisms, policies, and procedures that enable your business to protect data loss and continue operating in the face of disruption, particularly to its scanning, catalog, and insights tiers. This page explains how to configure a disaster recovery environment for Microsoft Purview.

Today, Microsoft Purview does not support automated BCDR. Until that support is added, you are responsible to take care of backup and restore activities. You can manually create a secondary Microsoft Purview account as a warm standby instance in another region.

The following steps show how you can achieve disaster recovery manually:

1. Once the primary Microsoft Purview account is created in a certain region, you must provision one or more secondary Microsoft Purview accounts in separate regions from Azure portal. 

2. All activities performed on the primary Microsoft Purview account must be carried out on the secondary Microsoft Purview accounts as well. This includes: 

    - Maintain Account information
    - Create and maintain custom Scan rule sets, Classifications, and Classification rules
    - Register and scan sources
    - Create and maintain Collections along with the association of sources with the Collections
    - Create and maintain Credentials used while scanning.
    - Curate data assets
    - Create and maintain Glossary terms


As you plan your manual BCDR plan, keep the following points in mind: 

- You will be charged for primary and secondary Microsoft Purview accounts. 

- The primary and secondary Microsoft Purview accounts cannot be configured to the same Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Share and Synapse Analytics accounts, if applicable.  As a result, the lineage from Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Share cannot be seen in the secondary Microsoft Purview accounts. Also, the Synapse Analytics workspace associated with the primary Microsoft Purview account cannot be associated with secondary Microsoft Purview accounts. This is a limitation today and will be addressed when automated BCDR is supported. 

- The integration runtimes are specific to a Microsoft Purview account. Hence, if scans must run in primary and secondary Microsoft Purview accounts in-parallel, multiple self-hosted integration runtimes must be maintained. This limitation will also be addressed when automated BCDR is supported. 

- Parallel execution of scans from both primary and secondary Microsoft Purview accounts on the same source can affect the performance of the source. This can result in scan durations to vary across the Microsoft Purview accounts.
